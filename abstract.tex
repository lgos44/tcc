In this graduation project, is presented the kinematic modeling and control of a manipulator with four degrees of freedom, with application on the TETIS manipulator, developed by the DORIS project. Control strategies based on the kinematic approach were developed and implemented, highlighting the proportional with feedforward controller for trajectory tracking, the position based visual servoing using computer vision algorithms and force control with a proportional integral controller.

The development and architecture of a software to control robotic manipulators using Robot Operating System and Qt as frameworks is shown. Lastly, simulation and experimental results are discussed.
